  <h2>EXPERIENCE</h2>
    <table class="table-style">
      <tr>
        <td style="text-align: justify;">I have some work experience and also used to be a secretariat at the AIS club as a student at Uitm I studied. Among the experiences I got while working in a restaurant and also catering was being able to make myself more patient in serving customers. In addition, I can be independent and have integrity when calculating sales revenue. I can also learn to be polite when talking to incoming customers.Then, my experience as an AIS secretariat was when I was given the responsibility to be a facilitator for other students during the "Induction" program. I also gained experience such as managing time more efficiently and carefully when making a decision.</td>
